Stock Trend Analysis (2020–2025) – Post-Pandemic Comparison

This project analyzes stock trends of multiple publicly traded companies between 2020 and 2025, focusing on the post-pandemic period—a time marked by economic recovery, technological growth, and market fluctuations. As my first exploration of stocks, I found this both challenging and highly educational.

Project Goals

Post-Pandemic Multi-Company Comparison: Examine how different companies responded to similar market conditions following the pandemic, highlighting variations in recovery and growth strategies.

Year-by-Year Company Analysis: Track individual company performance over time, showing how internal growth scores and external events influenced long-term stock behavior after the pandemic.

Dataset Highlights

Quantitative measures: average price change, earnings growth, growth scores.

Qualitative indicators: market sentiment, growth signals, macroeconomic context.

Approach

The analysis combines numerical data with visualizations to provide clear insights into stock behavior. By comparing companies and identifying top/bottom performers year by year, the project illustrates how post-pandemic dynamics impacted different firms differently.

This hands-on project allowed me to learn about stocks while applying programming and data analysis skills in a real-world context.
